# Multidisciplinary Exploration of the Intersection between Computer Vision and Aesthetics: Image Stacking Techniques 
## Stacking using the Function
- A flexible and reusable function that can take in multiple images and scale them to a desired size
- Uses advanced techniques such as Gaussian blur, canny edge detection, and morphological operations to manipulate the images in interesting ways
- Ability to label each image with a custom text that can be positioned and styled as needed
- Demonstrates the benefits of modular programming and code reuse
## Stacking images without Function
- A straightforward demonstration of how to horizontally and vertically stack two images without using any function
- Showcases the raw power of OpenCV's image manipulation capabilities
- Serves as a solid starting point for beginners who want to get started with image manipulation using OpenCV

### How to use:
for .pynb extention files :
			install all dependent library
			run each cell and if any input is missing like if any file requires image then provide image name and save image in same folder
				

For .py files:
			open .py file and install all dependencies
			open command prompt by typing cmd at adress bar of folder
			type python file_name.py
			check for error most of the error will be either for missing libraries or some may be of having no  image in such case download similar context image.
			for videocapture(0) error : it will only raise if you have another webcam and primary webcam is not working in such case
			place videocapture(1) and it'll run just fine.

for pytesseract ocr reader module:
			go through this [file.](https://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/bl/global/early%20indian%20printed%20books/training%20resources/installing%20and%20using%20tesseract%20500%20ocrfinal.pdf?la=en&hash=E0E8C2BC01D3FFF68A891265642CFF29#:~:text=Scroll%20down%20and%20select%20tesseract,files%20you%20have%20just%20downloaded)
